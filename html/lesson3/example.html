        My name is August Ada King. I'm the Countess of Lovelace.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am a mathematician and a writer. People know me from my work on Charle's Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical engine. I wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. In other words, I am the world's first programmer.
        </p>

        <p>
        My mother, Anne Isabella Byron,  was a great help to me as she helped me by promoting my interest in mathematics and logic, but I also never forgot about my dad, who moved to Greece when I was just an infant to help out in the civil war.

        <em>
          I do not believe that my father was such a poet as I shall be an Analyst; for with me the two go together indissolubly.</em>
