        Grace Hopper was born in 1906. She received her B.A. from Vassar and her Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale. In 1943, Grace Hopper joined the Navy WAVES. Commissioned a lieutenant in July 1944, she reported to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project where she was quickly put to work at the Mark I and later Mark II computing machines.

        Grace Hopper's importance in the fledgling area of computers lay in her development of the computer compiler. Her compilar freed programmers from having to write repetitive codes and ensured fewer errors. Rather than having programmers repeat each set of instructions every time particular instructions were needed, instructions that were common to all programs were available in the computer's own memory and could be referred to when needed.

        Grace Hopper pioneered the use of natural language in programming that would lead to the creation of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) for the UNIVAC, the first commercial electronic computer. Disregarding the naysayers who said English couldn't be used to instruct computers, Hopper used well-known English words and terms instead of computerese to capture the semantics and operators of data processing. She was promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983, and later to Admiral. Grace Hopper died in 1992.</p>
        <p>The late Rear Admiral Grace Hopper's spectacular scientific achievements have become international. She had changed the ever-growing world of the computer.
        </br>
        As a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar, she went on to receive a M.A. and Ph.D. degree at Yale. Her return to Vassar as an assistant in mathematics progressed to an associate professorship and further studies at New York University. She brought her mathematical abilities to the nation when, in 1943, she entered the U.S. Naval Reserve commissioned as lieutenant. As a senior mathematician with Sperry Rand, she worked on the first commercial computer. As Director of Automatic Programming, she published the first paper on compilers in 1952. Since that time she has published over fifty papers on software and on programming languages.

        While on active duty with the Naval Data Automation Command, this remarkable woman traveled throughout the world speaking to thousands about the future of computers.

        She had contributed over $34,000 to the Navy Relief Society from honoraria she had received on those engagements.</p>
